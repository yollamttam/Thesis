\chapter{First Things First}
\section{Cosmic Context}
Before diving into the details of the work that was completed as part of this Ph.D, it is important that we first put the work in the proper context. When spending such a large proportion of our time concerned with the details of a given research area, it is easy to lose perspective of the big picture. The big picture here is that, without having any say in the matter, we have come to occupy the Universe that we see around us and would like to understand it. 

\section{The Shoulders of Giants}

Before we begin, it is first worth appreciating the difficulty of what we are trying to do. Essentially, we care about measuring the properties of the intergalactic gas -- not stars or galaxies -- when the Universe was only $\sim$1 billion years old, a seemingly impossible task. Fortunately, we are given the invaluable gift that light travels at a finite speed and, as such, if we look at distant objects, we see them as they were in the past. Therefore, if we look at the at the gas between galaxies $\sim$13 billion light years away from us, we will see it was it was roughly 13 billion years ago, when the Universe was only 1 billion years old. This means that, in principle, this information is available to us. However, even taking this into account, the intergalactic gas we care about is not bright and it is located $\text{extremely}^{\text{extremely}}$ far away, so how are we supposed to observe it? An exciting aspect of studying the Epoch of Reionization is that, when confronted with such a seemingly impossible task, experts in the field have developed many different creative approaches toward constraining the properties of the young IGM in order to learn about the Epoch of Reionization. We discuss a selection of these methods in this chapter.

\subsection{The \lya\ Forest}

Arguably the most powerful tool for constraining the high-redshift IGM to date has been the \lya\ forest\nomenclature[Zp]{\lya\ Forest}{This describes the pattern of absorption lines seen blueward of the rest-frame \lya\ line, typically in quasar spectra. These absorption lines can be due to significantly neutral gas in the diffuse IGM or due to dense ionized gas.}. The \lya\ forest results, in part, from another invaluable gift to the field of cosmology: the redshifting of light with the expansion of the Universe. Basically, as the Universe expands, space itself expands and with it the wavelengths of photons travelling through it expand as well. If we know the expansion history of the Universe, and know the intrinsic color of a luminous object, then we can use its \textit{observed} color to determine our distance to the object. Because of this relationship, distances to objects are often measured as a redshift\nomenclature[Zp]{Redshift}{A quantity commonly used to refer to cosmic periods of time or distances. The redshift of an object or location in space is defined as the fractional increase in wavelength that a photon undergoes due to the expansion of the Universe while travelling from the object or location to us.}, defined as the fractional increase in wavelength that a photon experiences when travelling from a given distance to us, denoted by $z$. In other ``words": 

\begin{align}
\lambda_{\text{observed}} &= \lambda_{\text{emitted}}(1+z_{emitter}). 
\end{align}

The \lya\ forest can be seen in the spectrum of an extremely bright background object, usually a quasar\nomenclature[Zp]{Quasar}{It's bright, OK?} or a gamma-ray burst (GRB)\nomenclature[Zp]{GRB}{Gamma-Ray Burst. They are also really bright, OK?}, after its light has been processed by the intervening gas. Since the intervening gas is primarily composed of hydrogen and since this hydrogen is generally in the ground state, any intervening neutral patches will absorb light from the background object at the Lyman-series wavelengths, with the strongest absorption occurring at the \lya\ wavelength: $\lambda_{\alpha} \approx 1216$\AA. If the Universe were not expanding, then all intervening neutral hydrogen would absorb light from the quasar at one wavelength: $\lambda_{\alpha} \approx 1216$\angstrom, neglecting the other lines in the Lyman-series for the moment. However, due to the expansion of the Universe, photons emitted from the quasar \textit{blueward} of the \lya\ line will redshift as they travel towards us. If they encounter neutral hydrogen as they redshift through the \lya\ line, then they will be absorbed and an absorption line will be seen in the spectrum of the background quasar at a wavelength \textit{blueward} of \lya. This process is sketched in Figure \ref{fig:LyaCartoon}. Thus, the \lya\ forest is the pattern of absorption lines seen blueward of the rest-frame \lya\ line in quasar spectra due to intervening neutral gas. 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=12cm]{lyaf-75.eps}
  \caption{Illustration of the basic physics behind the \lya\ forest and how gas at different locations along the line of sight results in absorption lines at different wavelengths. (Image from {\tt http://www.astro.ucla.edu/})}
  \label{fig:LyaCartoon}
\end{figure}

The same logical progression also applies to the other lines in the Lyman-series, with the difference that lines deeper in the series have a smaller cross section for absorption. Therefore, you could imagine observing a \lyb\ and Ly\ $\gamma$\ forest at smaller wavelengths. Another important difference here, though, is that photons emitted from a background source with energies larger than \lyb\ will redshift through the \lyb\ wavelength and \textit{also} possibly through the \lya\ wavelength before reaching us. The photon's physical location when it redshifts through those two wavelengths will be completely different and, therefore, when observing absorption lines in the \lyb\ forest, it can be difficult to tell if the photons were absorbed by distant gas undergoing a \lyb\ transmission or closer gas undergoing a \lya\ transition. This problem is clearly exacerbated when considering higher-order lines since a larger number of distinct regions along the line of sight can contribute to the absorption.


We show two example quasar spectra in Figure \ref{fig:LyaExample}. The spectrum in the top panel is for a quasar at relatively low redshift and shows very little absorption. Meanwhile, the quasar in the bottom panel shows little absorption for emitted wavelengths redward of \lya\ but is heavily punctuated by absorption blueward of \lya\ due to intervening neutral hydrogen. It is this pattern of absorption features with $\lambda_{\beta} \leq \lambda_{\text{emitted}} \leq \lambda_{\alpha}$ that is referred to as the \lya\ forest.
 
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=12cm]{Lya-forest-60.eps}
  \caption{Flux as a function of rest-frame wavelength for a quasar at $z = 0.158$ (top) and $z = 3.62$ (bottom). The denser IGM at higher $z$ results in a dense ``forest" of absorption lines blueward of the rest-frame \lya\ line in the lower panel. (Image from {\tt http://www.astro.ucla.edu/})}
  \label{fig:LyaExample}
\end{figure}

At this point, the \lya\ forest should sound like a perfect tool: if we want to map the distribution of neutral hydrogen along the line of sight to a distant bright source, we can simply map each absorption line in the \lya\ forest to a parcel of neutral hydrogen. However, the story becomes complicated here due to the extremely large cross section for \lya\ absorption. Namely, the optical depth\nomenclature[Zp]{Optical Depth}{Optical depth, denoted by $\tau$, is a quantity that describes that likelihood for a photon to be absorbed, usually by a gas. The fraction of photons that will pass through the gas unabsorbed is $e^{-\tau}$.} for \lya\ absorption of a neutral hydrogen gas parcel obeys the relationship

\begin{align}
\tau_{\alpha} &\approx 3.3 \times 10^{4} \xhi (1 + \delta) \left[\dfrac{1+z}{6.5}\right]^{3/2}. \label{eq:tauGP}
\end{align}

Using this expression, we can calculate the minimum neutral fraction needed for a gas parcel at mean density to allow 1\% transmission at $z = 5.5$:

\begin{align}
.01 &= e^{-\tau_{\text{min}}} \implies \tau_{\text{min}} \approx 4.6\\
4.6 &\approx \tau_{\alpha} x_{\text{HI,min}} \\
\implies x_{\text{HI,min}} &\approx 0.00014.
\end{align}


This reveals the fly in the ointment here: even a gas parcel that is 99.9\% ionized will allow less than 1\% transmission at the redshifts of interest for reionization. This allows absorption features to be caused by highly-ionized gas that happens to be over-dense. Therefore, we can not simply map absorption lines in the \lya\ forest to regions of significantly-neutral hydrogen. In fact, the second example quasar we see in Figure \ref{fig:LyaExample} shows significant \lya\ absorption and is located at $z = 3.62$, \textit{much later than the end of reionization}. At this point, the reader may ask what utility does the \lya\ forest have at all? Well, an enormous amount. To name a very few applications outside of reionization, since \lya\ absorption can be caused by matter overdensities the \lya\ forest can be used to measure the matter power spectrum in the IGM which in turn can be used to measure the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), provide lower limits on the mass of the dark matter (\citealt{Viel:2013fqw}), and constrain dark energy. Additionally, absorption features due to damped \lya\ absorbers (DLAs) can be used to measure the primordial deuterium abundance as a test of big bang nucleosynthesis.\\

\noindent But how to constrain the EoR?



\subsubsection{Evolution of $\tau_{\text{eff}}$}

% The Gunn-Peterson optical depth to \lya\ photons is \tau_{\text{GP}} = \dfrac{\pi e^2}{m_e c} f_{\alpha} \lambda_{\alpha} H^{-1}(z)n_{\text{HI}}

% Absorption is understood as being caused by the fluctuating Gunn-Peterson effect, low density regions in approximate thermal equilibrium between photoionization heating by the UV background and adiabatic cooling due to the Hubble expansion, rather than discrete \lya\ absorbers.

% By studying the evolution of the average transmitted flux or effective optical depth, one can trace the evolution in the 

% You probably want to re-read and refer to Lidz et al. that discuss that the evolution in the effective optical depth can be replicated by density fluctuations

A common assumption made in analyzing quasar spectra at $z < 6$ is that, due to the presence of transmission in the spectra, the IGM must already be highly-ionized. 



\subsubsection{Dark Pixel Covering Fraction}

As demonstrated in the previous section, interpreting measurements of the effective optical depth in the context of reionization is complicated and model-dependent. However, an alternative approach is to consider what constraints can be made without resorting to model-dependent assumptions. In this regard, an important method in estimating $\axhi$ from high-redshift quasar observations is the dark pixel covering fraction. This approach is rooted in the fact that neutral parcels of gas are certain to result in saturated absorption in quasar spectra due to their optical depths being $\tau_{\text{HI}} \gtrsim 10^4$ (Eq. \ref{eq:tauGP}). Therefore, a reliable upper bound on the neutral fraction at a given redshift can be estimated by the fraction of pixels in quasar spectra that are completely absorbed at that redshift. 

An obvious drawback of this method is that, at $z \sim 6$, overdense yet ionized regions can very well result in saturated absorption as well and significantly increase the upper bound on the neutral fraction. One approach to combat this effect is to incorporate the \lyb\ forest into the analysis. The optical depth for Lyman-series transitions scales as $f\lambda$, where $f$ is the oscillator strength of the transition and $\lambda$ is the corresponding wavelength. Therefore, the analogous expression of Eq. \ref{eq:tauGP} for \lyb\ is:

%Useful quantities:                                                                                                   
% Oscillator Strengths                                                                                                
% f_21 = 0.4162 (1s-2p)  lambda_21 = 1215.67 AA                                                                       
% f_31 = 0.0791 (1s-3p)  lambda_31 = 1025.72 AA                                                                       
% f_32 = 0.4349 (2s-3p)  lambda_32 = 6562.74 AA 
\begin{align}
\tau_{\beta} &= \tau_{\alpha} \times \dfrac{f_{\beta}\lambda_{\beta}}{f_{\alpha}\lambda_{\alpha}} \approx 5.3 \times 10^{3} \xhi (1 + \delta) \left[\dfrac{1+z}{6.5}\right]^{3/2}. \label{eq:tauGPB}
\end{align}

where $f_{\alpha} = 0.4162$, $\lambda_{\alpha} = 1216 \AA$, $f_{\beta} = 0.0791$, and $\lambda_{\beta} = 1026\AA$. From this expression, we can see that a mean-density parcel of neutral gas should cause saturated absorption in both the \lya\ and \lyb\ transitions. Meanwhile, ionized overdense regions are less likely to cause saturated absorption as their optical depth in \lyb\ is reduced by a factor of $f_{\beta}\lambda_{\beta}/f_{\alpha}\lambda_{\alpha} \approx 1/6$. Therefore, limits from the dark-pixel covering fraction may be improved by requiring simultaneous absorption in both \lya\ and \lyb\ as part of the definition of a dark pixel. Additionally, the \lyb\ dark pixel covering fraction on its own is a viable tool for establishing an upper bound on the neutral fraction, although foreground \lya\ absorption may undo some of the gains from the lower $\tau_{\beta}$ value.

This procedure faces several complications when actually carried out, however. First, quasar observations are subject to the noise from the night sky which effectively adds mean-zero random noise to the spectra. The addition of this random noise can result in spurious transmission in pixels that otherwise would have been completely absorbed. Therefore, to measure the dark pixel fraction in quasar spectra, one first needs to create a suitable definition of what classifies as a ``dark" pixel. One approach here is to define dark pixels as having transmission below some threshold defined in terms of the noisy standard deviation, $\sigma_{\text{N}}$. This presents us with a tradeoff, however, since larger thresholds will reduce the number of neutral pixels we miss but also increase the number of ionized pixels that get incorporated into the dark pixel population.

A second complication is that, since pixels have a finite width, their transmission values effectively represent an average of the transmission over some region in the spectra. If the pixel width is large enough, then it is possible for a pixel to have non-zero transmission despite corresponding to a physical region that contains significantly-neutral gas. For example, if the physical region in space associated with the pixel is 80\% composed of completely-neutral gas and 20\% composed of completely ionized gas which allows full transmission, then the transmission of that pixel will be 20\% and will likely not qualify as a ``dark pixel" despite containing neutral gas. Thus, even in a measurement as seemingly-simple as the dark-pixel covering fraction, these details must be kept in mind when interpreting results.

Regardless, \cite{McGreer:2011dm} and \cite{McGreer:2014qwa} apply the dark-pixel covering fraction approach to 22 high-redshift quasar spectra to produce the constraints on $\axhi$ shown in Figure \ref{fig:McGreer}. Dimly-colored points correspond to \cite{McGreer:2011dm} while bold-colored points correspond to \cite{McGreer:2014qwa}. The main conclusion here is that model-independent constraints have a hard time conclusively confirming the common knowledge that reionization has ended by $z \sim 6$.\footnote{The authors here do go on to focus on a high-resolution subset of their quasar observations in order to argue in favor of an end to the EoR by $z \sim 6$. However, the precise interpretation of the spectra is complex, as discussed herein.}

\subsubsection{Dark Gap Sizes}
\subsubsection{Damping Wing Redward of \lya}

Much of the difficulties in using the \lya\ forest to constrain the timing of the EoR can be boiled down to the following problem: interpreting \lya\ absorption in high-redshift quasar spectra is difficult because both neutral and ionized gas can result in saturated absorption. Therefore, it is worth asking if there are any ways to break this degeneracy in \lya\ absorption in order to determine which absorption is likely due to neutral hydrogen. One potential approach toward this goal, which has received much attention ({\bf cites}), is looking for the hydrogen damping wing redward of the \lya\ line. 


To understand this approach, let us first understand what the hydrogen damping wing is. For many applications, it is suitable to consider an atom's ability to absorb radiation as a series of delta functions in frequency: when incident radiation has a frequency exactly coinciding with the energy of the transition, then there is a non-zero probability for absorption and zero probability otherwise. In reality, the probability of absorbing a photon of a given frequency, e.g., the line profile, is a continuous distribution which, while small for frequencies $\nu \neq \nu_{0}$, is non-zero. 


The intrinsic line profile for the \lya\ transition in the hydrogen atom can be seen as arising from the time/energy uncertainty principle, $\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \gtrsim \hbar$. Specifically, the finite lifetime of the $n = 2$ excited state implies the existence of a range of energies that can excite or result from the transition. The distribution of this range of energies follows a Lorentzian distribution ({\bf glossary}):

\begin{align}
\phi(\nu) &= \frac{1}{\pi} \dfrac{\Gamma/4\pi^{2}}{(\nu - \nu_{0})^{2} + (\Gamma/4\pi)^2}
\end{align}

with the corresponding absorption cross section

\begin{align}
\sigma_{\alpha}(\nu) &= \dfrac{\pi e^2}{m_{e}c} f_{\alpha} \phi(\nu).
\end{align}

The ``damping wing" refers to the $\sigma \sim 1/(\nu-\nu_{0})^{2}$ behavior far from line center. This can be used to break the degeneracy between HII absorption and HI absorption because the optical depth is so much smaller in the damping wing that, without significantly-neutral gas (optical depth scales with neutral fraction), the optical depth at such frequency separations will not be sufficient to cause absorption. Furthermore, the damping wing has a distinct shape which can be fit for in order to infer the properties of the neutral gas which sources it. 


While the damping wing from an isolated neutral region in a sea of fully-ionized, $\tau = 0$ hydrogen would stand out like a sore thumb, in reality absorption from the surrounding dense, yet ionized, gas will punctuate the damping wing with additional absorption features and will make it harder to detect. However, photons emitted slightly \textit{redward} of \lya\ cannot be absorbed by dense ionized gas since ionized gas has a negligible optical depth for $\nu \neq \nu_{\alpha}$. Neutral hydrogen, on the other hand, \textit{will} allow absorption to take place redward of \lya\ due to the significant optical depth in the damping wing. Because of this, most damping-wing searches up until now have looked slightly redward of \lya.


It is worth pointing out, however, that this method is not without drawbacks. First, detecting the damping wing redward of \lya\ relies on your ability to understand what the quasar flux \textit{would have} been in the absence of the absorbing gas nearby the \lya\ line (this unabsorbed flux is referred to as the quasar \textit{continuum} and predicting the unabsorbed flux for a given quasar is called \textit{continuum fitting}). Predicting the \lya\ line properties in quasars is notoriously complicated. Second, searching for the damping wing redward of \lya\ inherently involves measuring the gas properties nearby the quasar. However, quasars are extremely rare and special objects and it is not obvious that their surroundings are representative of the IGM on average ({\bf cite Lidz}). For example, ({\bf cite Lidz} et al.) found that quasars are more likely to inhabit over-dense regions which ionize earlier, suggesting that interpreting the \textit{lack} of a damping wing is not straightforward. Gamma-ray burst spectra are gaining attention in this regard ({\bf cites}) as they tend to occupy more typical regions of space and have an easier-to-model continuum flux. The drawbacks of GRBs, though, is that they are often accompanied by a host absorber whose damping-wing absorption must be separated from that of the IGM. Third, even when provided with a clean detection of the damping wing redward of \lya, this will only tell you about one region of space and it will be difficult to use this single observation to extrapolate to the ionization state of the IGM as a whole. In \SS 

%Alternatively, the line profile for the hydrogen atom can be calculated classically by treating the electron as being harmonically-bound in the potential of the proton. The oscillations of the electron are intrinsically damped due to the fact that accelerating charges emit radiation. Furthermore, when we consider the probability of incident radiation being absorbed, the incident radiation can be seen as a driving force for the oscillator. 


% There is always a small damping of the oscillations by the radiation reaction force. I think this basically means that, since the charge is accelerating, it must be emitting radiation and losing energy and therefore its motion must be damped. Tau in this context is the time for radiation to cross a distance comparable to the size of the classical electron radius
