\chapter{First Things First}
\section{Cosmic Context}
Before diving into the details of the work that was completed as part of this Ph.D, it is important that we first put the work in the proper context. When spending such a large proportion of our time concerned with the details of a given research area, it is easy to lose perspective of the big picture. The big picture here is that, without having any say in the matter, we have come to occupy the Universe that we see around us and would like to understand it. 

Any organised system requires energy, be it a machine of some kind or a live organism. Energy is needed to win the uphill battle against entropy and pull together lifeless molecules to be able to do something in this world, like complete a PhD\nomenclature[Zp]{Ph.D}{Acronym}.
