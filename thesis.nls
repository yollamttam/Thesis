		\nompageref{195}

 \nomgroup{R}

  \item [{$\ ^{*}$}]\begingroup Conjugate\nomeqref {5.0}

 \nomgroup{X}

  \item [{11HUGS}]\begingroup 11 Mpc Halpha and Ultraviolet Galaxy Survey\nomeqref {5.0}
		\nompageref{195}

 \nomgroup{Z}

  \item [{\lya\ Forest}]\begingroup This describes the pattern of absorption lines seen blueward of the rest-frame \lya\ line, typically in quasar spectra. These absorption lines can be due to significantly neutral gas in the diffuse IGM or due to dense ionized gas.\nomeqref {1.0}
		\nompageref{6}
  \item [{CMB}]\begingroup Cosmic Microwave Background. This is the earliest available snapshot of the Universe and is composed of light which has travelled from the surface of last scattering to today, largely unimpeded.\nomeqref {1.0}
		\nompageref{1}
  \item [{GRB}]\begingroup Gamma-Ray Burst. They are also really bright, OK?\nomeqref {1.1}
		\nompageref{6}
  \item [{Hjerting Function}]\begingroup Also known as the \textit {Voigt Function}, this function is commonly used in describing line profiles which incorporate Doppler broadening and the natural line width. This function is very relevant when studying the hydrogen damping wing.\nomeqref {1.32}
		\nompageref{22}
  \item [{IGM}]\begingroup Intergalactic medium. This refers to the gas between galaxies, which constitutes most of the baryonic matter in the Universe.\nomeqref {1.0}
		\nompageref{1}
  \item [{Lorentzian Distribution}]\begingroup Probability distribution for the ratio of two standard-normal-distributed variables. This distribution also describes the intrinsic line profile for absorption lines.\nomeqref {1.21}
		\nompageref{17}
  \item [{Optical Depth}]\begingroup Optical depth, denoted by $\tau$, is a quantity that describes that likelihood for a photon to be absorbed, usually by a gas. The fraction of photons that will pass through the gas unabsorbed is $e^{-\tau}$.\nomeqref {1.1}
		\nompageref{8}
  \item [{Quasar}]\begingroup It's bright, OK?\nomeqref {1.1}
		\nompageref{6}
  \item [{Redshift}]\begingroup A quantity commonly used to refer to cosmic periods of time or distances. The redshift of an object or location in space is defined as the fractional increase in wavelength that a photon undergoes due to the expansion of the Universe while travelling from the object or location to us.\nomeqref {1.0}
		\nompageref{6}
  \item [{Voigt Function}]\begingroup Also known as the \textit {Hjerting Function}, this function is commonly used in describing line profiles which incorporate Doppler broadening and the natural line width. This function is very relevant when studying the hydrogen damping wing.\nomeqref {1.32}
		\nompageref{22}
  \item [{2MASS}]\begingroup Two-Micron All Sky Sruvey\nomeqref {5.0}
		\nompageref{195}
